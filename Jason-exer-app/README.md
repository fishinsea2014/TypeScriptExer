# Exercise Notes
+ AngularJS services are substitutable objects that are wired together using dependency injection (DI). You can use services to organize and share code across your app. AngularJS services are: Lazily instantiated â€“ AngularJS only instantiates a service when an application component depends on it.
+ Handle the global interface, data and methods.
+ Steps of using service, take get data as example:
    + Create the data set, as in dir of service;
    + Create the service and define the get data methods, as in app.article.service.ts;
    + In the component of using the service
        + import the services
        + Add 'providers' in @Component segment
        + In the component class:
            + Reference the service in constructor
            + Define the methods to using the services
            + Reference the methods in 'ngOnInit'

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests
